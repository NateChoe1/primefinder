There are several methods for generating prime numbers in this program. Going through them all would take a long time, so here's a brief summary:
Coprime method (checking if all numbers coprime to n are prime)
Sieve of eratosthenes
Combined coprime and sieve of eratosthenes
Fermat's little theorem
Finding mersenne prime numbers (This is impractical, but it gets large primes)
