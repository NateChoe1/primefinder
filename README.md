There are 2 methods for finding primes in this program. The first is by checking all numbers k above a multiple of n where k is the set of all numbers coprime to n. Here's an example:
The numbers coprime to 12 are 1, 5, 7, 11. This means that only numbers 1, 5, 7, or 11 above a multiple of 12 can be prime. This means 13. 17. 19. 23. 25. 29. 31, 35, etc."# primefinder"
